This project implements a coder agent using LangGraph
 as the orchestration framework, with support for:

Groq API (fast hosted LLM inference)

GPT-OSS (open-source local fallback via HuggingFace/Transformers)

The agent takes a user prompt, processes it through LangGraph, and returns structured outputs.
